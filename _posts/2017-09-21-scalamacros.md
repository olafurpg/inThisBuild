title: "Roadmap towards non-experimental macros"
date: 21-9-2017
---

This week, the Scala Center begins a new initiative to bring
non-experimental macros into the official scalac and dotc distributions.
This project will be developed in close collaboration with Scala community, the
Dotty team at EPFL and Scala compiler team at Lightbend.
This initiative follows [SCP-014], a proposal that got approved with an
overwhelming majority at the Scala Center Advisory Board meeting last week.


- Before: Unclear direction
- Now: Dialogue with community

- Before: big, complex API
- Now: small, simpler API
